    "text": "Lab #1 involved the configuration and testing of the E155 development board. First, all the necessary parts were soldered per the project board schematic. Then, to confirm functionality of the FPGA, the board was programmed so that the onboard LED would blink at a rate of 2.4Hz, using the onboard high speed oscillator (HSOSC). Then, the board was used to control a 7 segment display, with the input coming from a set of switches on the board, and the display showing the corresponding hex digit."
